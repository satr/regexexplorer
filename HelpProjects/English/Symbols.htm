<li>For symbols which are usually examined as literal, specifies, that the following symbol is special and should not be interpreted as literal. 
<p class = "Example">For example: "b" is match with a symbol "b". At a location of a symbol backslash before b, that is "\b", the symbol becomes special, designating border of a word.</p></li>
<li>For symbols which are usually examined as special, specifies that the following symbol is not special and should be interpreted as literal.
<p class = "Example">For example:<span class = "Symbol">*</span>it is a special symbol which means 0 or more concurrences to ocurrence of the previous symbol;</p>
<p class = "Example">For example: "a*" means 0 or more symbols "and". For substitution * as literal, it is necessary to put before it backslash;</p>
